Call me hot, not pretty\n\n\n\nBaby, do you like this beat?\n\nI made it so you'd dance with me\n\nIt's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees\n\nWhen you're doing it with me, doing it with me\n\n\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nSnap and clap and touch your toes\n\nRaise your hands, now body roll\n\nDance it out, you're hot to go\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nSnap and clap and touch your toes\n\nRaise your hands, now body roll\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\n\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nYou can take me hot to go\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nYou can take me hot to go\n\n\n\nWell, I woke up alone staring at my c\u0435iling\n\nI try not to care but it hurts my feelings\n\nYou don't have to stare, com\u0435 here, get with it\n\nNo one's touched me there in a damn hot minute\n\n\n\nAnd baby, don't you like this beat?\n\nI made it so you'd sleep with me\n\nIt's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees\n\nWhen you're doing it with me, doing it with me\n\n\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nSnap and clap and touch your toes\n\nRaise your hands, now body roll\n\nDance it out, you're hot to go\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nSnap and clap and touch your toes\n\nRaise your hands, now body roll\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\n\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nYou can take me hot to go\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nYou can take me hot to go\n\n\n\nWhat's it take to get your number?\n\nWhat's it take to bring you home?\n\nHurry up, it's time for supper\n\nOrder up, I'm hot to go\n\nWhat's it take to get your number?\n\nHurry up, it's getting cold\n\nHurry up, it's time for supper\n\nOrder up, I'm hot to go\n\n\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nYou can take me hot to go (Oh, yeah)\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nYou can take me hot to go (Hot to go)\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nYou can take me hot to go (Oh, yeah)\n\nH-O-T-T-O-G-O\n\nYou can take me hot to go\n\n\n\nWhew, it's hot in here\n\nIs anyone else hot?\n\nWoo, you coming home with me?\n\nOkay, it's hot\n\nI'll call the cab"
